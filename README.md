To sum up things you are free to use this material in any commercial and non commercial project as long as:
- proper credit is given to me (Heirukichi);

- if you modify anything, you still provide credit and properly mark the parts you have modified.

In addition, I would like to be notified if you use this in any project.
You can send me a message containing a link to the finished product using the contact form on my website (check my profile for the link).
The link is not supposed to contain a free copy of the finished product.
